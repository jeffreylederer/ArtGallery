1|500|Disability of Spirit|wood over glass||11|14|0|2001|handicapped man, bicycle, orrery|Olam Magazine feature 2001|gicleé print|'A Disability Of Spirit' is one of three illustrations that appeared in OLAM Magazine in 2001. These three digital prints were created from original black and white line illustrations. OLAM, meaning 'world' is a Judaic philosophical journal published by Suissa-Miller Advertising, Inc. in Los Angeles, CA. This publication, produced as a personal project by a principal in that agency solicits no advertising and is issued when funding is available, approximately twice a year. Each issue is centered on a theme, in this case, exploring the facets of disability. I chose to interpret disability as states of the spirit dominating those of the body. Here are some thoughts that inspired this image: Acknowledging the delicate balance of life lived in two worlds, this image addresses the loneliness and frustration of limited physical mobility that is enhanced, yet mitigated in its expression by unlimited imagination.

Because only a mask of Hypnos remained, I wondered how his son Morpheus and the rest of these deities might have appeared. The mystery of why I chose to explore this theme which was in progress when a dramatic family medical crisis occurred remains unsolved, but will no doubt find its way into future explorations of this theme. A clue to these future images came in the form of a visit to The British Museum in 2002 where I was happily surprised to see the actual Hypnos mask staring me from around the corner of the Elgin Marbles!|Hypnos+Morpheus.jpg|2|1

62|500|Renaissance III|metal over plexiglas||34.5|26.5|0|1986|knight, armor, businessman, horse, parking meter, PPG Place, Pittsburgh||giclee print on archival paper (2009)|'Renaissance III' is a story of a city with a long memory. Though time and economic considerations forced it to alter the foundation of its identity as a center of industrial production, they also opened a door to the evolution of that identity into a city engaged in a dynamic process of balancing service, industry and technology with a certain nostalgia and mythical romanticism that are the by-products of its multicultural demographics.  The components of this drawing signify the following ideas. The rising sun mitigates the colors of the dark sky to suggest the fading of our dark history of coal burning and steel production into a changing future whose face is yet to become clear. The towers of PPG's 'fortress' in the background refer to the imposing walls surrounding medieval city-states and the power concentrated within them. Reinforcing this is the 'corporate knight'. He represents the 19th and 20th century 'robber barons' that built this city and their fortunes on the backs of workers from the many cultures that distinguish the city. The traditional chain-mail garment worn by medieval knights under their armor has become his necktie while the folded computer printout (dot-matrix printers were still in use in 1985) is his handkerchief, a symbol of chivalry, courtly manners and privileged information that are the veneer and essence of modern boardroom politics. The ornate helmet, based on a fourteenth century Italian model, protects him against corporate intrigue and potential environmental outcome.
An equally ornate gauntlet covers the hand clutching a burly briefcase, but his thumb is exposed as a small reminder of the vulnerable humanity within the armor.  The knight's partially armored steed implies the city's transition from an identity based on the use of indigenous materials to one re-branded by service and technology. Soon to be replaced by it's digital descendant, a final symbol of Pittsburgh's transition is the vintage parking meter in the foreground, reminding us that time is money and money is the lingua franca of progress.

The original art for 'Renaissance III' was made for my elder son, whose interests it reflected at the time.

|ink,watercolor|This work actually began about ten years ago as a sketch entitled Sushi Under Clouded Moon following business trips to New York and Los Angeles, where my taste for these Japanese delicacies developed. I have always admired the spare, yet colorful sensuality of Japanese graphic design and the ways in which this sensibility translates to every aspect of that culture... particularly the presentation of food. The finished painting was put on hold in deference to a continuous stream of other projects, both personal and professional, yet always came tomind when I found myself in a Japanese restaurant.  On a recent trip to NY, I made a few sketches of the restaurant staff and customers in such an establishment and  considered these experiences  part of my research . This year at last, everything seemed to come together; the choice of watercolor as the medium and the  images  of Madame Ginger and Master Wasabi ... exchanging spicy stories of their travels amidst a feast of sushi. The tiny fisherman, guiding his craft on silky waves, is the eternal Guardian of The Sea of Tea.|SushiByTheSeaOfTea.jpg|2|1

Such is the case with 'The Draughtsman's Dream'. Initially I suspected this idea came from my daily immersion in the tools of mechanical layout and paste-up procedures required for pre-press work before the digital era. While that is partly true, I now know that the inspiration came from my first illustration assignment during my sophomore year at art school in Chicago. I was asked to draw some cartoons for an insect repellent manufacturer by a Chicago cartoonist whose office was located high in the medievally-inspired Chicago-Tribune Tower. The view of Lake Michigan was spectacular, but not quite as impressive as the way the Tower swayed in the high winds coming off the Lake.

Each issue is centered on a theme, in this case, exploring the facets of disability. I chose to interpret disability as states of the spirit that may dominate those of the body. Here are some of the thoughts that inspired this image: Acknowledging the delicate balance of life as we perceive it, this image addresses the mutability of our self-image and the forces, often beyond our control, that drive us to acknowledge and adapt to these changes for our mental and physical survival.|OLAMDeceitofVision2.jpg|2|2

The master craftsman escapes, but disobeying his father's warning to avoid flying close to the sun, the wax holding the feathers of Icarus' wings melt and the boy drowns in the sea, later named the Icarian Sea in his memory. Perched on Minos' palace roof is a ghostly partridge, representing the dead Talos, Daedalus' nephew and former apprentice. In another version of the story, the master craftsman jealous of his nephew's brilliance, pushed him from a cliff.

85|1500|The Messiah Stone|unframed||11|14|0|1999|Jerusalem, mosque, synagogue, priest, bishop, rabbi, imam||ink and watercolor on archival paper|'Messiah Stone' is drawn from several legends. It represents the stone at the center of the world known in Hebrew as 'even ha-sh'tiyah', a great gemstone engraved with the name of the Messiah. Formed on the first day of Creation, it served to cap the lower waters, called Tohu and Bohu when God separated them from the upper waters and was removed only once during the time of Noah to permit the Flood. The stone allegedly bears water erosion marks! Another tale relates that the stone floated with the wind until the Altar of Sacrifice was built on Mt. Zion. There it came to rest as a support for the Altar.  A passage in the Book of Isaiah calls it the Foundation Stone because the world was founded on it. "Thus saith the Lord, 'Behold I lay in Zion a foundation for a stone...a costly corner-stone of sure foundation." The Akedah, or Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac is said to have taken place upon it. In Arabic, the stone is called es-Sakhra and is the centerpiece within the Dome of the Rock, Kubbat es-Sakhra. An Arab tradition also states that 
all the fresh waters of the world have their origin under this rock. In this drawing, representatives of several major faiths hold each other for support as they balance upon  a whirling, omniscient 'messiah stone' loosed from its moorings and rising above the sands of the 'center of the world'.  It is my vision for the millennium. Perhaps the memory of its removal in ancient times will once again 'flood or obscure' evil,  permitting  world peace before the end of days.

For his act of treachery against Zeus, father of the gods, Sisyphus is banished to the underworld of Hades and punished through eternity, forced to push a rock up a hill only to have it roll back to the bottom just as he has attained the hill's crest. In my version, the hill in Hades has become a Zen sand garden and while Sisyphus appears to be pushing his rock in seemingly random patterns, these patterns are noted by the Buddhist monk who is the chronicler of Sisyphus' progress, offering hope that the once powerful king will one day understand his true path in death since he had not done so in life.

In an era when European travelers to other lands brought back tales of exotic creatures and botanical forms, imaginative artists drew from these descriptions, enhancing and often abstracting their images to suitably decorate formal religious documents. While we are largely unrestricted today in our freedom of artistic expression, I have chosen to honor the efforts of those artists who followed their faith yet passionately pursued their colorful dreams. In  'A Benighted Bestiary ', my  calligraphic vision of the second commandment, the letters themselves are unconventional in both form and placement while they support a menagerie of creatures born of our collective imagination.

|acrylic on archival paper|In 'Between Heaven & Earth, a visual interpretation of the second commandment, two angels appear in the upper and lower waters of creation separated only by a narrow, fiery horizon. The angel of the upper waters reaches towards the commandment written in Hebrew, representing its heavenly origin. The angel within the lower waters of earth containing the English translation of the commandment is a distinct reflection of the one above, in the sense that we were created in God's image. While reaching for its' feather, fallen in the transition or translation to the mundane world below, it grasps the upper angel's hand, attempting to retain the tenets of holiness. I created this image as a metaphor to explain the struggle of artists through the ages who have attempted to balance their need for self-expression with their needs for community and religious observance. The title for this work was incorporated in my book, 'Between Heaven & Earth: An Illuminated Torah Commentary (Pomegranate, 2009).

In this modest volume, originally written in Arabic (Kitab al Kuzari), Ha-Levi presented an account of an obscure chapter in Jewish history; the pagan conversion to Judaism in Khazaria, the first feudal state to be established in Eastern Europe. Completed in 1140 AD, The Kuzari contains a dialogue between the pagan king of the Khazars,  a Turkic people, who invited representatives of Christianity, Judaism and Islam to instruct him in their faiths. Afterwards, the king chose Judaism as the official 'state religion'.

This tale has inspired scholarly interpretation and controversy from Talmudic times through the eras of Kabbalah and Eastern European Hasidism (the setting I have chosen for this painting) to the present. The Four Who Entered Paradise' relates in symbolic detail the methods and results of an attempt by four eminent sages to reclaim a book given to Adam after his expulsion from Eden (Paradise) by the Angel Raziel. This fabulous volume, engraved on sapphire, was said to contain all the secret wisdom of the earth and heavens. It is mentioned periodically in Biblical commentaries from antiquity as having been passed down from Adam to Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, although King Solomon may have been the last major player to benefit from its magic before it finally disappeared. In essence, the legend serves as both a key to the process of spiritual development and as a cautionary tale to those who would attempt an esoteric level of study and meditation without intellectual maturity and proper guidance. This painting represents a new direction I have begun to explore as artist, illustrator and perpetual student of my ancestral legacy.

The ring evokes those used in wedding ceremonies throughout Europe in the 15th-18th centuries. These elaborate rings were often the property of the Jewish community and loaned to the bridal couple for the ceremony, to be replaced later by a standard gold wedding band. 
The tiny structure atop the ring metaphorically signified their new home and Solomons Temple, recalling the prosaic and prophetic nature of Jewish history. The water, whose waves form the words of a ketubah, represents the mutability of marriage, an ancient, yet always evolving tradition. 'The Jewish Bride' appeared on the cover of the Spring, 2000 issue of Lilith, a magazine for Jewish feminists. It was one of several images accompanying a feature on Jewish wedding customs.|TheJewishBride copy.jpg|1|1

The Kedushah refers to the mystical harmony of all created beings, both angelic and human who with one voice glorify the majesty of their Creator. This prayer is recited standing, then rising to the toes three times in succession as the words Kadosh, Kadosh, Kadosh (Holy, Holy, Holy) are pronounced. It is this physical expression of Kedushah or Holiness that most beautifully illustrates our transcendence of the material world as it urges us towards our spiritual destiny. Although Jewish law requires this prayer to be recited in the presence of a minyan (ten men who have achieved Bar Mitzvah), this image was intended to emphasize the participation of Jewish women in the ancestral legacy of prayer. The young girl, her mother and her mothers mother  speak for all women: for we are the guardians of the future of Faith.|KedushahTapestry.jpg|1|1

Inspired by my studies of myths, legends, and recent travels through Europe, ' In The Land of Yad' is a fantasy landscape where Torah pointers crown Babel-like towers surrounded by moats and rivers. The majesty of these structures are at once a reminder of our origins and of the complex and colorful nature of our Jewish identity. Beneath the sliver of a new moon, the tiny vessel with its turbaned sailors have entered this vision on their journey towards the wonder of renewed faith.

Mi'shoakh Manot  dish, fish, Adar II, Haman||color pencil and watercolor on archival paper|The Jewish holiday of Purim, celebrated on the 14th day of Adar, according to the Hebrew calendar, is a time of miracles, marked by merrymaking and masquerade. Among several traditions, the public reading of the Megillah, or The Book Of Esther, is made meaningful by costumes representing characters in the story and by the custom of  mi'shloach manot or the giving of food to spread the joy of the holiday. Though the story includes several important characters, 'The Purim Players' is my interpretation for three of the central characters in the old story. The masked young woman in the image represents Esther, a beautiful Jewish orphan who became Queen to King Ahashverus of Persia and later the mother of Cyrus, the Persian king under whose reign the Jewish population flourished. Haman, the King's evil advisor, is represented  here by two 'groggers' or noisemakers held by the young boy in the curly bearded mask of King Ahashverus. These devices, modeled after artifacts from medieval Germany are shaken or rattled each time the name of Haman is read in the story to drown out his name and the memory of his evil machinations to destroy the Jews of Persia. The Hebrew script on them translates as 'curse Haman'. Esther holds a silver dish containing the gifts of food for the holiday. The dish is in the shape of a fish to represent the astrological sign of Pisces and also the month of Adar. |Esther&ThePurimPlayer.jpg|1|1

The chair, a masterwork of intricately carved flora and fauna was regarded by the Breslov Hasidim as a worthy throne for their Rebbe. The Rebbe used this chair throughout the rest of his life; studying, teaching and offering spiritual guidance in matters mundane and mystical to all who needed it. After his death in 1810 at the early age of 38, the chair retained its place next to the Ark in the Breslov synagogue as evidence of the Rebbes presence. It remained there until the Nazi invasion during World War II when the Breslovers were forced to flee for their lives. The chair, however, presented a difficult problem. Realizing that it could not be smuggled out of Breslov intact, the decision was made to disassemble it and distribute each of the small sections among the Hasidim. A vow was then taken to meet in Jerusalem where the chair would again be made whole. Although the journey was risky and fatal for many, those who carried sections of the chair arrived safely in Israel.
By 1959, Rabbi Nachman s chair was restored by Katriels of Jerusalem and has since resumed its place of honor next to the Art in the Breslov synagogue at Meah Shaarim in Jerusalem.
Although the Breslov Hasidim were left without a leader, Rabbi Nachman had assured them that appointing a successor would not be necessary, since his spirit would always guard and guide them. To this day, each Rosh Hashanah, nearly 4,000 of Rabbi Nachmans disciples from all over the world gather at his grave in Uman, in the Ukraine to be with their Rebbe.

Mouths punctuate closely packed bricks, their multicolored tongues simultaneously babbling multiple languages.
The bricks morph into a figure which emerges atop the tower. It is the ambitious, King Nimrod who, in his hubris, sports three faces in constant motion emphasizing the confusion and vanity inherent in his challenge to God. He holds no sword towards heaven, only the empty threat of his clenched fist. It seems that if one is to challenge the existence and power of God, it had better be done intellectually. The explosion of red and yellow spatters the horizon with the blood of destruction in the face of the breakdown of communication while the figures fleeing towards opposite directions in the foreground explore their own mouths in the search for familiar speech. All the figures appear transparent, for artists/artisans are inextricably linked to their creations. The four-colored rivers flowing out of the image represent human dispersion toward the four corners of the earth where they must unravel the intricate knot that has become human communication if they wish to survive as a species.

Here is a minyan (a prayer quorum of ten Jewish men) performing a prayer known as Al Chet (the ch is pronounced gutturally). In this prayer, we ask forgiveness for the sins which we have committed unknowingly such as insulting a loved one, or being disrespectful to an elder. Only one woman is shown in the balcony of the synagogue for three reasons. First, in the Orthodox tradition, men and women must sit separately during services so as not to distract each other during prayer. Second, although women are not technically required to attend services in deference to domestic duties, their spiritual presence may be felt. Third, because one womans role in maintaining the existence and balance of faith is so important, it must never be underestimated.

At the same time, Psalm 107:17-20 and a verse from The Book of Job (33:23-24) are recited. The fowl is then given to charity, although money is sometimes substituted. The custom began in gaonic times (during the 6th through 13th centuries)where it was primarily supported by those involved in kabbalistic practices.

It depicts a ritual performed on the afternoon of the first day of Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year). At this time, ones pockets are emptied over a flowing body of water such as a river to symbolize the casting off of sins. Biblical prayers concerning sin, repentance, and forgiveness are recited from the Book of Micah (7:10-20). This ritual originated in medieval Germany and was later adopted by Oriental and Sephardic Jews. Here, three men are shown with  goats legs and hooves drawn from the legend of Azazel (in the 16th chapter of Leviticus) where one of two goats is sent to wander to his death in the wilderness carrying the sins of the Jewish people on his back. The other goat was to be sacrificed in the Temple. Tashlikh is an allegory for the continuous cycle of good and evil, each of which seems to need the other to exist. It shows us that although we have the opportunity to redeem ourselves at this special time, we are not perfect and will most likely accumulate these or other sins again throughout the coming year, thus requiring annual atonement.

These in turn flank a representation of the keruvim or cherubs that were to rest on the ark's cover.

I was particularly drawn to Bezalel Ben Uri Ben Hur, the artist/craftsman entrusted with the design and construction of The Ark Of The Covenant and to Moses, God's messenger to Bezalel. The chapters in Exodus that describe that divine inspiration in great detail especially fueled my artistic curiosity to imagine what I might have seen had I been there millennia ago. This series of drawings would contribute to my understanding when, twenty years later, I would write and illustrate 'Between Heaven & Earth: An Illuminated Torah Commentary' (Pomegranate, 2009).|color ink,watercolor||TabernacleTrilogyBezalel.jpg|1|1

Ibn Paquda is best known for his treatise that established the first Jewish system of ethics called 'Guide to the Duties of the Heart'. Though my interpretation appears somewhat literal, the blank pages in the writer's journal are meant to convey that despite our best intentions, our utterances rarely match the subtle passions in our hearts.  |TongueIsPenOfHeart.jpg|1|1

'Uncle Frank' was my mother's uncle by marriage and by extension, my great-uncle. As an Eastern European Jewish immigrant, his job as a sweatshop presser was one of the few employment options for a man who spoke little English and who probably originated in a village farming community in the 'Old Country'.|UncleFrankInTheSweatshop.jpg|1|1

He lived with us and like his wife Miriam and her sister Malke was extremely religious, attending synagogue throughout the day and maintaining a strictly kosher diet. A quiet, studious man, he could always be found behind his Forverts (Jewish Daily Forward newspaper) smoking a very odiferous cigar...|UncleShloimeh.jpg|1|1

It is the result of my first experiment with zinc-plate etching and the use of aquatint. It preceded the series, 'The Rituals Of Atonement' in 1974 and was done in a very small limited edition of 10.

166|1000|Yosef Golem|plexiglas envelope||25|33|0|1993|golem, children, Prague, fire, medieval architecture||ink and color pencil on archival paper|'Yosef Golem' is based on the legend of the Golem (Yiddish for  Man Of Clay) created by Rabbi Judah Loew, also known as The Maharal Of Prague (Czechoslavakia) in the late 16th century. Using ancient Kabbalistic formulae, Rabbi Loew and his assistant created an imposing magical figure to serve as the defender of the Jews of Prague in response to the blood libels and pogroms leveled at them by local gangs of thugs and royal mercenaries. There are several versions of this classic tale, casting other rabbinic luminaries in the role of the Golems creator, but for this drawing I have chosen to focus on the Golem itself as a symbol of the strength and belief at the core of Jewish identity. Firmly supporting two children, symbols of hope, he stands against the background of the burning city which represents the centuries of brutal hatred unleashed on the Jewish people by forces beyond their control.|YosefGolem copy.jpg|1|1

169|200|Kapparot|none||22|30|0|1975|kapparot, yom kipper, chicken, attonement, ceremony, day of attonement||etching|In Kapparot, the viewer is witness to a fowl being swung over the head of one whose sins are symbolically transferred to the bird on the morning before Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. At the same time, Psalm 107:17-20 and a verse from The Book of Job (33:23-24) are recited. The fowl is then given to charity, although money is sometimes substituted. The custom began in gaonic times (during the 6th through 13th centuries) where it was primarily supported by those involved in kabbalistic practices.

Although only one observer is traditionally required, two are shown to emphasize that this practice unites all generations of Jewish women through the laws of family purity. Following the immersion ritual, three stars are seen in the sky indicating the onset of the Sabbath. Now the woman may return home to light the Sabbath candles and preside over her family gathering.

176|1200|Crucicution|metal over glass||24|32|0|1984|crucifixion, cross, storm sky, Roman soldier, businessman, barbed wire crown||ink and watercolor on archival paper|The images in this work are not intended to literally reflect religious ideology. Rather, they are visual metaphors for the repression of creativity in the name of political  correctness  in a society which fears controversy in the arts. At issue here is the sacrifice of the individual to the needs of the corporate structure and its attendant addiction to technology.  Is technology our ticket to understanding the underpinnings of the world to come?  This is a frightening thought for me. Is too much knowledge dangerous to our sanity? The roots at the base of the crosses symbolize the nourishment that the creative spirit requires even as it surrenders to the corporate entity.  Ultimately, that spirit  will be regenerated to create anew for Hope still flickers at the bottoms of the pandoric boxes we all possess.

I wanted to illustrate a legend that attributes mystical properties to these figures by which they demonstrate the emotional and political condition of the Israelites. When all was harmonious, the figures faced each other; when discord arose, they faced away from each other.|Arketype.jpg|1|1
